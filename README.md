## Multiple Choice Quiz App with JSON and JavaScript
Make a single page multiple choice quiz app using JavaScript and JSON. There should be at least 3 different multiple choice questions and they should be stored in JSON file called questions.json. The main page uses AJAJ (AJAX) call to fetch JSON file from the same web server and uses it to build a web page with a mobile friendly user interface. After the user presses a button the JavaScript code will first verify if the user has replied all the questions, then it will display how many questions the user got correct.
